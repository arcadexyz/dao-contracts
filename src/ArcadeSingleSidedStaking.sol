/**
 * @title ArcadeSingleSidedStaking
 * @author Non-Fungible Technologies, Inc.
 *
 * @notice To optimize gas usage, unlockTimeStamp in struct UserDeposit is stored in
 *         uint32 format. This limits timestamp support to dates before 03:14:07 UTC on
 *         19 January 2038. Any time beyond this point will cause an overflow.
 *
 * The ArcadeSingleSidedStaking contract is set up like a traditional staking contract,
 * but with a twist: instead of earning tokens as rewards, users deposit their ARCD tokens
 * in the contract and get dâ€™App points in return. Earned points are tallied up off-chain
 * and account towards the $ARCD Rewards program and its Levels.
 *
 * Upon depositing, users are required to commit to a lock period where tokens are
 * immovable, until the chosen lock period expires. Early  withdrawal is not permitted.
 * Users have the flexibility to make multiple deposits, each accruing points separately
 * until their lock period concludes.
 *
 * Should users choose not to withdraw their tokens post the lock period, the
 * funds will seamlessly transition into a subsequent points tracking cycle if
 * one should start. Unlike the initial deposit, the funds in the consequent point
 * tracking cycles are not bound by a lock period and can be freely withdrawn anytime.
 *
 * The lock period gives users the opportunity to enhance their points earnings
 * with a bonus multiplier that is contingent on the duration for which the user
 * chooses to lock their deposited tokens. The available lock durations are categorized
 * as short, medium, and long. Each category is associated with a progressively increasing
 * multiplier that enhances the number of point rewards accrued in the d'App, with the short
 * duration offering the smallest and the long duration offering the largest.
 *
 * When a user decides to lock their ARCD tokens for one of these durations,
 * their deposit bonus amount is calculated as:
 * (deposited amount * multiplier for the chosen duration) + original
 * deposited amount.
 * This boosts the user's points earnings in proportion to both the amount deposited
 * and the duration of the lock for the deposit.
 *
 * In the exitAll() external function, it's necessary to limit the number of
 * processed transactions within the function's loops to prevent exceeding
 * the block gas limit. Because of this, the contract enforces a hard limit
 * on the number deposits a user can have per wallet address and consequently
 * on the number of iterations that can be processed in a single transaction.
 * This limit is defined by the MAX_DEPOSITS state variable. Should a user
 * necessitate making more than the MAX_DEPOSITS  number of deposits, they will
 * be required to use a different wallet address.
 *
 * The contract gives users governance capabilities by also serving as a voting
 * vault. When users deposit, they gain voting power which they can use in
 * ArcadeDAO governance. Users' voting power is automatically accrued to their account
 * and is delegated to their chosen delegatee's address on their behalf without the
 * need for them to call any additional transaction.
 * The ArcadeSingleSidedStaking contract governance functionality is adapted from the
 * Council LockingVault deployment at:
 * https://etherscan.io/address/0x7a58784063D41cb78FBd30d271F047F0b9156d6e#code
 *
 * Once a user makes their initial deposit, the voting power for any future deposits
 * will need to be delegated to the same address as in the initial deposit. To assign
 * a different delegate, users are required to use the changeDelegate() function.
 * A user's voting power is determined by the quantity of ARCD tokens they have deposited.
